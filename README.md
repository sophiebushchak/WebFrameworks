# AmsterdamEvents

This project was made as a university course project. It involved doing assignments every week for 14 weeks long. 
The project is split up into two parts. There is an Angular front-end and a back-end in Java Spring Framework with Sprong Boot.

## Context
The assignments were done around the idea of a website that displays upcoming events in Amsterdam that people could sign up for. The events can either be free or cost money, and they can have a ticket limit or no ticket limit. 

## Features
The project is not usable and was purely made for educational purposes. The front-end is quite shallow and only allows for adding events and editing their status and information. The back-end has an endpoint for registering for events, but this does not appear in the front-end.
In the back-end, there are endpoints for posting and updating events. An event can be deleted, and there is a confirmation when the user wants to leave the event they are currently editing if changes were made.
There is also a login and register system using JWT as the authentication.

## Structure
The main folder contains the Angular front-end, and the "aeserver" folder contains the whole of the back-end server.
It can be ran the same way and Angular or Spring project can normally be ran.
